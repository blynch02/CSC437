            <h2>The Iconic Play</h2>
            <p>With 58 seconds left in the game and the 49ers trailing 27-21, quarterback Joe Montana threw a high pass to Dwight Clark in the back of the end zone. Clark leaped and made a fingertip catch to score the touchdown that, after the extra point, gave the 49ers a 28-27 victory.</p>
            
            <p>This play, forever known as "The Catch," is considered one of the most famous plays in NFL history and marked the beginning of the 49ers dynasty of the 1980s. It also symbolized the changing of the guard in the NFC, with the 49ers replacing the Cowboys as the conference's dominant team.</p>
